I’m a technical content engineer working on documentation for AI developer tools. This blog is where I think out loud about technical writing, developer experience, documentation systems, and learning in public.

The posts here are informal and exploratory. I write to clarify my own thinking, share lessons I’m picking up along the way, and connect with others doing similar work across engineering, documentation, and developer education.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-deaton-002220355/).

## Background

After studying psychology and French in college and teaching English in France, I spent three years managing workshops at a conference center in Abiquiu, New Mexico. That experience exposed me to the challenges of operating complex systems in a setting where resources and technology were scarce, which sparked my interest in thoughtful systems design.

This realization prompted a pivot to tech. I completed a coding bootcamp, then worked as a full-stack engineer at Angaza, followed by a brief SRE role at Coinbase. I later found my niche in developer education at Twilio and then worked as a developer experience engineer at WRITER.

## Current focus

I’m currently a technical content engineer at Anthropic, where I work on Claude Code documentation. My work sits at the intersection of building, explaining, and advocating for better developer experiences, especially around AI-assisted coding tools.

I care a lot about practical documentation, mental models, and helping developers feel confident using powerful but sometimes opaque systems.

## Personal life

Outside of work, I enjoy knitting and hanging out with my family.
