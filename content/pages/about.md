I'm a technical content engineer at Anthropic, focused on [Claude Code documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview).

## Background

My career path has been unconventional. After studying psychology and French in college and teaching English in France, I spent three years managing a conference center in remote Abiquiu, New Mexico. That experience exposed me to the challenges of operating complex systems in a setting where resources were scarce, which sparked my interest in thoughtful systems design.

This realization prompted a pivot to tech. I completed a coding bootcamp, then worked as a fullstack engineer at Angaza, followed by a brief SRE role at Coinbase. I later found my niche in developer education at Twilio.

## Current focus

At Anthropic, I work on Claude Code documentation, combining my background in building, explaining, and advocating for better developer experiences. I love helping developers understand how to work effectively with AI-assisted coding tools.

## Blog topics

My writing explores three main areas:
- **AI and developer productivity**: protocols like MCP, tools such as Cursor, and LLM safeguards
- **Critical analysis**: examining research and hype-driven claims
- **Personal projects**: sharing side projects and reflections on everyday systems

## Personal life

Outside work, I enjoy knitting and reading children's stories with my child, finding inspiration in how the simplest systems can be the most delightful.
