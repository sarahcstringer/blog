I'm a technical content engineer at Anthropic, focused on [Claude Code documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview).

## Background

After studying psychology and French in college and teaching English in France, I spent three years managing workshops at a conference center in Abiquiu, New Mexico. That experience exposed me to the challenges of operating complex systems in a setting where resources and technology were scarce, which sparked my interest in thoughtful systems design.

This realization prompted a pivot to tech. I completed a coding bootcamp, then worked as a fullstack engineer at [Angaza](https://www.angaza.com/), followed by a brief SRE role at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). I later found my niche in developer education at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) and then worked on Developer Experience at [WRITER](https://writer.com/).

## Current focus

At Anthropic, I work on Claude Code documentation, combining my background in building, explaining, and advocating for better developer experiences. I love helping developers understand how to work effectively with AI-assisted coding tools.

## Personal life

Outside work, I enjoy knitting and hanging out with my family.
